For this Nest JS project, we will use @nestjs/typeorm for persistence and Postgres as the database, so please take this into account when answering the questions.

We will use class-validator and class-transformer to validate and transform the data.

We will use '@nestjs/testing' for testing. Generate tests for the services and controllers when you are asked to write tests using the jest framework.

Do not use `any` to define the types of the variables.

Use dependency versions that are compatible with the current version of this Nest JS project.

Use modules to organize the code and separate concerns.

Use `uuid` to generate the IDs and use the `uuid` version 4 standard.
